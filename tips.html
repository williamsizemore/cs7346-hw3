			<h2><mark>Don't Apply too Much Thermal Paste</mark></h2>
			<p class="MsoNormal">It's a silly little step, but it's something 
			people constantly argue about online: what's the best way to apply 
			thermal paste? I've seen people do some pretty crazy things, like 
			put on a giant blob or spread it around with a credit card, when it 
			really couldn't be simpler. Just put a small, pea-sized dab in the 
			middle (lentil-sized, really), or a thin line about the size of a 
			grain of rice. Then put your heatsink on and start screwing it in. 
			The pressure will spread it out for you.<o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">There are always exceptions to this rule, like 
			very high- or low-viscosity pastes (like ones made with actual 
			silver). But for the average paste, the process really is this 
			simple. If ever in doubt, just check the instructions that come with 
			your paste or look at the manufacturer's web site. In fact, their 
			web site should also tell you which method (pea or rice) is best for 
			your specific brand.<o:p></o:p></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal">In the end, your application method shouldn't 
			make a huge difference unless you're using really specialized, 
			expensive thermal pasteâ€”which, by the way, probably&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/thermal-paste-performance-benchmark,3616.html" target="_blank">won't 
			make a huge difference in your temperatures</a>. Just don't use too 
			much and you'll be fine. If you want more information,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/thermal-paste-heat-sink-heat-spreader,3600.html" target="_blank">this 
			article at Tom's Hardware</a>&nbsp;has all you need to know.<o:p></o:p></p>

			<h2><mark>Save Your Boxes</mark></h2>
			<p>When you're done building, don't throw out those boxes or 
			anti-static bags. They can come in handy when selling your parts 
			later down the line and can be used to store all the extra cables, 
			screws, brackets, and other parts that aren't used. </p>
			<p>Don't throw the unused parts away, either, as they may come in 
			use later down the road.</p>

		<div id="tip2" style="display:none;">
			<h2><mark>Don't Over Tighten Screws</mark></h2>
			<p> This is a mistake happens a lot especially with&nbsp;CPU coolers. 
			Many users think the tighter the better. Overall the goal is to 
			ensure a solid secure bond, this can generally be achieved with a 
			little more than finger tight. Exceeding this can cause serious 
			issues. Why? Strain, torsion and unneeded pin / pad contact. 
			</p>
			<p> Consider that when mounting the cooling solution you are have the 
			CPU which has a pad which is being push down against a socket with 
			pins. Excessive pressure can cause memory channels to drop and even 
			cause instability when pad makes contact with the socket. This is 
			due to the fact the memory controller is in the CPU and needs to 
			registered the pins from the motherboard socket to registered and 
			initialize all the DIMMS physically installed. </p>

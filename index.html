	<h1>Building a Computer</h1>
	<p class="MsoNormal">Computers are everywhere and used by everyone for 
	multitudes of reasons. Most people buy their computers off the shelf already 
	built, usually made by companies like Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Buying 
	pre-built computers comes built in fees for putting the computer together 
	and testing and even for simply having a certain brands logo on it.
	<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It is also quite often that the 
	components used in these computers aren’t the latest and greatest and aren’t 
	as good as they should be for the price range the computer is being sold 
	for. <o:p></o:p></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">PC gaming has become much more popular in the last 
	few years giving a rise in popularity to PC building. The rise of PC building 
	has also brought about innovations that have made it easier for the average 
	user to build a powerful computer. Building a PC, simply put, involves ordering the 
	computer parts that fit your budget and putting them in the right slots, 
	almost like Legos for adults. There are seemingly endless combinations you can use to find the right PC for 
	your needs and even your personality with different choices in color scheme.<o:p></o:p></p>
	<p class="MsoNormal">To first understand how to build a computer, however, 
	one must know all the required components that is needed and know what they 
	are used for to better understand what fits their needs. <o:p></o:p></p>

				onmouseup="enlarge('cpu')"alt="Central Processing Unit (CPU)">The central processing unit (CPU), also 
			called a&nbsp;processor, is located inside the&nbsp;computer case&nbsp;on the 
			motherboard. It is sometimes called the brain of the computer, and 
			its job is to carry out commands. Whenever you press a key, click 
			the mouse, or start an application, you're sending instructions to 
			the CPU. <br><br>The CPU is usually a&nbsp;two-inch ceramic square&nbsp;with 
			a&nbsp;silicon chip&nbsp;located inside. The chip is usually about the size of 
			a thumbnail. The CPU fits into the motherboard's&nbsp;CPU socket, which 
			is covered by the&nbsp;heat sink, an object that absorbs heat from the 
			CPU.<br><br>&nbsp;A processor's&nbsp;speed&nbsp;is measured in&nbsp;megahertz 
			(MHz), or millions of instructions per second; and&nbsp;gigahertz (GHz), 
			or billions of instructions per second. A faster processor can 
			execute instructions more quickly. However, the actual speed of the 
			computer depends on the speed of many different components—not just 
			the processor.

				onmouseup="enlarge('gpu')"alt = "Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)">A GPU is an expansion 
			card which generates a feed of output images to a display/monitor. 
			The GPU is a discrete or dedicated card meant for processing images 
			and visual effects more effectively than the CPU. It is similar to 
			how a CPU functions using cores, however, GPUs will have many more 
			cores that are lower power and do simple tasks in parallel to 
			compute the results faster than the CPU could as it has less cores 
			but each one is very powerful. <br><br>CPUs will often contain an 
			integrated graphics chip that is suitable for video playback and 
			some light gaming. Dedicated graphics cards will greatly increase 
			performance in more intensive games and applications that utilize 
			the GPU.</td>

			<td class="ms-list1"><img src="img/ram.jpg" height="191" id="ram"class="myImg"width="233" onmouseup="enlarge('ram')" alt="Random Access Memory (RAM)">
			RAM is your system's&nbsp;short-term memory. Whenever your computer 
			performs calculations, it temporarily stores the data in the RAM 
			until it is needed. <br>This&nbsp;short-term memory disappears&nbsp;when the 
			computer is turned off. If you're working on a document, 
			spreadsheet, or other type of file, you'll need to&nbsp;save&nbsp;it to avoid 
			losing it. When you save a file, the data is written to the&nbsp;hard 
			drive, which acts as&nbsp;long-term storage. <br>RAM is measured 
			in&nbsp;megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB). The&nbsp;more RAM&nbsp;you have, the more 
			things your computer can do at the same time. If you don't have 
			enough RAM, you may notice that your computer is sluggish when you 
			have several programs open. Because of this, many people add&nbsp;extra 
			RAM&nbsp;to their computers to improve performance.

			<td class="ms-list1"><img src="img/hdd.jpg" id="hdd"class="myImg"height="184" width="207" onmouseup="enlarge('hdd')" alt="Hard Disk Drive (HDD)">
			The&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;is where your software, documents, and other files 
			are stored. The hard drive is&nbsp;long-term storage, which means the 
			data is still saved even if you turn the computer off or unplug it.
			<br>When you run a program or open a file, the computer copies some 
			of the data from the&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;onto the&nbsp;RAM. When you&nbsp;save&nbsp;a file, 
			the data is copied back to the&nbsp;hard drive. The faster the hard 
			drive, the faster your computer can&nbsp;start up&nbsp;and&nbsp;load programs. <br>

			<td class="ms-list1"><img src="img/ssd.jpg" id="ssd"class="myImg"height="154" width="267" onmouseup="enlarge('ssd')" alt="Solid State Drive (SSD)">A solid state drive is a device that uses 
			integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently. 
			SSDs have no moving mechanical parts like HDDs do, which makes them 
			more resistent to physical shock, and allows them to run silently. 
			SSDs are much faster and have lower latency than HDDs but currently 
			are more expensive per Gigabyte of storage.<br><br>A common setup is 
			to have a SSD as the drive with the operating system on it, while 
			having an HDD for mass storage like games and other large 
			applications. This allows the user to benefit from the increased 
			boot time speed and overall speed of the operating system while 
			still maintaining necessary storage space for programs or files that 
			do not require the extra speed of the SSD.&nbsp;

			converts AC power from the wall to low-voltage regulated DC power 
			for the internal componenets of a computer. The PSU connects to 
			certain devices within the computer that requires power such as the 
			motherboard, GPU, and disk drives. Many of the parts that plug into 
			the motherboard receive power from the motherboard which receives 
			the power from the PSU, and even the graphics cards can receive some 
			of the power from the motherboard while at the same time using power 
			straight from the PSU.<br><br>There are different power ratings that 
			range from 250 watts to over 1000 watts, which determines the 
			maximum power draw that is limited on that specific PSU. Efficiency 
			also plays a role into power supplies, in which the higher quality 
			PSUs will have the "80 plus" branding on them to determine the 
			efficiency. The "80 plus" branding has multiple tiers of quality 
			ranging from "80 plus" to "80 plus titanium" with multiple other 
			levels in between which are a simple way of knowing the efficiency 
			of the power supply. The greater the efficiency, the greater the 
			savings on power use and lower heat output, however, the benefits 
			are more substantial on computers that use a lot of power compared 
			to less power hungry hardware.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

			and allows them to communicate with each other. You directly install 
			the CPU, RAM, and GPU on the motherboard with the storage drives 
			being connected via Sata cable to the motherboard.<br><br>The 
			motherboard also contains all the ports for peripherals like a 
			mouse, keyboard, and audio device. Motherboards are made to work 
			with specific models of CPUs which use the same socket type. A 
			socket 1151 motherboard will support CPUs that specify support for 
			1151 socket type, any other CPU will not fit or work properly unless
